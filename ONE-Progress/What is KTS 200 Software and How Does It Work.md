KTS 200 software runs on a handheld device called KTS 200, which has a game console style and a user-friendly interface. The device connects to the vehicle's electronic control unit (ECU) via a vehicle-specific connector. The software guides the user through a menu for defining the vehicle and communicating with the ECU. It provides comprehensive diagnostic functions, such as reading and clearing fault codes, displaying live data, performing actuator tests and reprogramming.
 
KTS 200 software is updated quarterly by DVD or via internet download. It also comes with a total support package from Bosch, which includes diagnostic training, technical support hotline and local software development. KTS 200 software is compatible with Bosch's SIS software, which offers diagnostic trouble shooting and repair information.
 
KTS 200 software is a reliable and affordable solution for independent workshops that need to diagnose and service a wide range of vehicles. It helps users to save time and money, while ensuring quality and customer satisfaction.
  
One of the advantages of KTS 200 software is that it supports the Euro 5 standard, which requires original manufacturer data for diagnosis, service, repair and maintenance to be available to independent workshops since 2009. This means that users can access the same information as authorized dealers and perform ECU diagnosis and reprogramming with Bosch PassThru software.
 
Another benefit of KTS 200 software is that it covers a wide range of vehicles, including passenger cars, light commercial vehicles and trucks. It supports both European and Asian brands, as well as some American models. It also works with various systems, such as engine, transmission, ABS, airbag, air conditioning and more. Users can easily find the right connector for each vehicle with the help of Bosch's ESI[tronic] software.
 
KTS 200 software is not only a diagnostic tool, but also a learning tool. It helps users to improve their skills and knowledge by providing detailed information on each fault code, live data parameter and actuator test. It also offers tips and tricks on how to perform certain tasks and procedures. Users can also access Bosch's training catalogue and online courses to learn more about diagnostics and vehicle systems.
  
In conclusion, KTS 200 software is a powerful and versatile diagnostic tool that can help independent workshops to provide high-quality service and repair to their customers. It offers easy and fast access to original manufacturer data, comprehensive diagnostic functions, regular software updates and a total support package from Bosch. It also supports a wide range of vehicles and systems, and helps users to improve their skills and knowledge.
